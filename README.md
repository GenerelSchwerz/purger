# purger
A discord purger. That's it. Optional keyword to use.


Two commands: 

default prefix: "!" (change in the file itself, didn't bother with json files for stuff this basic."

(prefix)purge <optional: x> = deletes x amount of your own messages. If no x, it will delete every message you've ever sent in the channel.
Oh yeah, the channel is wherever you send this command.

(prefix)pword <keyword> <optional: x> = deletes x amount of messages you sent with the keyword. If no x, it will delete every message containing the keyword you've ever sent in that channel.
channel is still the same channel you sent the command in.

Change your token inside the file, all the way at the bottom.
